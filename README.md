# Web-Scrapping_Challenge-11_KNOVAK

Hello,

Thank you for taking the time to review my Challenge 11 which covers web scrapping methods.

You can find my work in the folder labeled IPYNB. Within that folder you will find my IPYNB's for Part 1 Mars News and Part 2 Mars Weather.
You can find the answers analysis questions on the IPYNB for Part Mars Weather.

In the folder labeled CSV you will find the .csv file that I saved at the end of the Part 2 Mars Weather IPYNB.

In the folder labeled JSON File, you will find the optional JSON file that I created for Part 1 Mars News IPYNB.

Please disregard the commit messages for CSV and JSON File, the changes made were the removal of empty folders.

As always please reach out should you have any questions.

Cheers,
- Kyle Novak
